# Team-Profile-Generator

Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

Unfortunately this application it's not finished yet.

Things left to do:

* Validate user responses.
* Add options for user to create a new employee
* Set more testing for different changes in the HTML files
* Create different card templates for different types of employees. e.g. manages, engineers.
* Place employee cards into a main HTML template where they will be given style using CSS.
